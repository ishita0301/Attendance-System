**How Facial Recognition Works?**

A facial recognition software captures and compares patterns on a person’s face and analyses the details to identify and verify the individual. While the underlying system is complex, the whole technology can be broken down into three steps:

	1) Face Detection: An essential step is locating human faces in real-time
	2) Transform Data: Once captured, the analogue facial information is transformed into a set of data or vectors based on a person’s facial features
	3) Face Match: The system matches the data above with the one in the database for verification
	
**Algorithms Used:**

	1) Haarcascade Opencv (Object/Face Detection)
	2) LBPH Opencv (Face Recognition)
